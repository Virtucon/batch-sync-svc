DB_USERNAME=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# Application Configuration
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
SERVER_PORT=8080

# Optional Database Tuning
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MIN_IDLE=5
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Run with production profile
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=prod batch-sync-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Or with environment variable
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
